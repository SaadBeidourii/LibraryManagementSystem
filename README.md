# Library Management (Rust)

This project aims to develop a simple library management system using Rust. The application allows users to add, delete, and search for books in a virtual library. It also includes additional features such as loan tracking, user management, and report generation.

## Development Steps

1. **Define Data Structures:** Begin by defining the necessary data structures, including structures for books, users, and loans.

2. **Implement Basic Features:** Implement basic functionality such as adding books, deleting books, and searching for books by title or author.

3. **Loan Tracking:** Add the capability to track loans, recording who borrowed a book and when it is due for return.

4. **Command-Line Interface (CLI):** Set up a command-line interface (CLI) to provide an interactive way for users to interact with the library management system.

5. **Additional Features:** Customize the project by adding features that suit your preferences, such as user management, generating reports on current loans, or any other functionalities you find relevant.

## Rust Concepts to Explore

While working on this project, you'll have the opportunity to explore various Rust concepts, including:

- Secure memory management with Rust's ownership system.
- Usage of data structures, enumerations, and traits.
- Handling strings and vectors.
- Error handling with Rust's error management system.
- Utilizing Rust's standard collections, such as `Vec` and `HashMap`.
- Organizing code using modules and packages.

Feel free to dive into these Rust concepts to enhance your understanding and proficiency with the language.
